As a distinguished engineer, I make decisions that affect the entire engineering organization. In the AI era, these decisions have become both more impactful and more uncertain.

This blog is where I think out loud about:

- **Technical strategy** — How to evaluate and adopt new technologies at scale
- **AI in practice** — Not the hype, but what actually works in production
- **Engineering leadership** — The hard choices that don't have clean answers
- **Architecture** — Designing systems that will still make sense in 2 years

I write for senior engineers, architects, and technical leaders who face similar decisions. No clickbait, no "10 tips" listicles — just honest thinking about hard problems.

Let's figure this out together.
